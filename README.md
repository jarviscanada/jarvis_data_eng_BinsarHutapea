**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BinsarHutapea/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented tools for gathering information regarding hardware information and usage on machines on a cluster. The information is retrieved using Bash scripts that were written in this project and then stored on a PostgreSQL database. retrieving and storing hardware information and usage of machines on a cluster. Crontab is utilized for automating script execution periodically.

## Highlighted Projects
**SmartProp - Blockchain-based Smart Property Ownership Management System on IPFS**: Investigated the use of Blockchain technology outside the crypto-currency realm to build Dapps, which is an application made of a smart contract and a user interface and built on a decentralized network that combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface. Built a decentralised secure online marketplace using Ethereum and other Blockchain technologies for trading properties items. Utilized Solidity for smart contract programming tasks and React framework for frond-end programming tasks. Performed integration of Dapps with IPFS to overcome the file size limitations on Blockchain and expand its user base.
