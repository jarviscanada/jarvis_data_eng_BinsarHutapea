# Binsar Hutapea . Jarvis Consulting

I am very enthusiastic about venturing into the world of Software Development to seek the challenges of utilizing it in the industry to solve real-life problems. I have prior industry experience as an application developer, where I was deeply involved in developing, testing, and deploying multiple web-based applications for multiple corporations, where I used Java and Typescript within Spring and Angular frameworks for performing programming tasks, MySQL and Oracle for interacting with the databases, and Selenium for performing automated testing.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BinsarHutapea](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BinsarHutapea)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BinsarHutapea/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented tools for gathering information regarding hardware information and usage on machines on a cluster. The information is retrieved using Bash scripts written in this project and then stored on a PostgreSQL database. Crontab is utilized for automating script execution periodically.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BinsarHutapea/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - JDBC App: Built an application to retrieve, process, and display data from a database. PostgreSQL is used as the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) in this application. Additionally, Docker is utilized to manage a PostgreSQL instance. Also, Maven is utilized to manage this project and its dependencies.
  - Grep App: Implemented a tool with Java 8 for retrieving strings of text from files based on user-specified regular expressions. The program searches every existing file and subdirectory and writes any matched strings to an output file. In addition, Maven is utilized to manage this project and its dependencies. Also, this program is Dockerized and shared on Docker Hub.


## Highlighted Projects
**SmartProp - Blockchain-based Smart Property Ownership Management System on IPFS**: Investigated the use of Blockchain technology outside the crypto-currency realm to build Dapps, which is an application made of a smart contract and a user interface and built on a decentralized network that combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface. Built a decentralised secure online marketplace using Ethereum and other Blockchain technologies for trading properties items. Utilized Solidity for smart contract programming tasks and React framework for frond-end programming tasks. Performed integration of Dapps with IPFS to overcome the file size limitations on Blockchain and expand its user base.
